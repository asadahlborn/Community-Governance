## **Discussed Topics**

### 2. **clarification on the origin of the tokens that are up to a community decision in this upcoming vote"**

They also don't originate from any events where a "bug" happened. 

### 3. **The Firefly voting layout**

We showcased the current design and UI/UX flow for the vote.
