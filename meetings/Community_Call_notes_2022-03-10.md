## **Discussed Topics**

### **2. Latest Firefly updates**

The Firefly Team still makes progress! Most changes are merged, Tests are already including the use of Ledger Nano for voting, and only minor fixes are currently implemented regarding the general layout and account structure of Firefly that will also be introduced in the next update. The new account structure and the combination and definition of staking and voting events in the UI presented some challenges that are currently being worked on.
- once this has been done, a first release candidate will be moved over to the community Firefly closed beta tester group.
- After they have battle-tested everything, we will announce the date for the vote and prepare the Firefly release with the new functionalities.

### 3. **Treasury Task Force**

We have started several working groups for interested community members to prepare solutions for the case that the build/burn vote will have an outcome to build a community treasury DAO.

- Building this DAO will take a lot of engaged community members.
- We should already start to gather talents in anticipation of a possible outcome and be prepared accordingly. Presenting different possibilities of treasury management to the community needs extensive research and collaboration

The following topics/workgroups have been created and have dedicated Threads in the Governance discussions Discord Channel:
- DAO Smart Contracts
- DevOps / Infrastructure
- Communications
- Legal Setup
- Voting methods
- Finance / Accounting
- Treasury / Tokenomics
- Governance Structure
- Treasury vision

As a first project, the Governance structure group wants to create a study/paper for the community that researches and explains how other projects handle and govern their treasuries. Over the following weeks, the members do deep dives into the structures of several projects and collect insight on how they do DAOs.
The plan is to release an extensive analysis paper for the IOTA community with recommendations on what works well and what would be better avoided.
Members have already collected Maker DAO, ENS, and Yearn Finance resources. More projects will follow and be added to the resource database. Interested members are invited to join the discussions and take up tasks here: https://discord.com/channels/397872799483428865/943861734727372871



### 4. **Community initiative for a bridge funding solution until the Treasury DAO goes live**

Another group of community members thinks about making a certain amount of funds available earlier as the full operating Treasury DAO. If you want to engage in these discussions, you can follow them here: https://discord.com/channels/397872799483428865/943895458546339870
