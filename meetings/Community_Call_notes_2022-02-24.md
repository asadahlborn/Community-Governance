## **Discussed Topics**

### **2. Latest Firefly updates**

The Firefly Team makes excellent progress! Most changes are merged, Tests are already including the use of Ledger Nano for voting, and only minor fixes are currently implemented regarding the general layout and account structure of Firefly that will also be introduced in the next update.
- once this has been done, a first release candidate will be moved over to the community Firefly closed beta tester group.
- After they have battle-tested everything, we will announce the date for the vote and prepare the Firefly release with the new functionalities.

### 3. **Treasury Task Force**

We have started several working groups for interested community members to prepare solutions for the case that the build/burn vote will have an outcome to build a community treasury DAO.

- Building this DAO will take a lot of engaged community members.
- We should already start to gather talents in anticipation of a possible outcome and be prepared accordingly. Presenting different possibilities of treasury management to the community needs extensive research and collaboration

The following topics/workgroups have been created and have dedicated Threads in the Governance discussions Discord Channel:
- DAO Smart Contracts
- DevOps / Infrastructure
- Communications
- Legal Setup
- Voting methods
- Finance / Accounting
- Treasury / Tokenomics
- Governance Structure
- Treasury vision

As a first project, the Governance structure group wants to create a study/paper for the community that researches and explains how other projects handle and govern their treasuries. 
Over the following weeks, the members do deep dives into the structures of several projects and collect insight on how they do DAOs.

The plan is to release an extensive analysis paper for the IOTA community with some recommendations on what works well and what would be better avoided.

### 4. **New Governance Forum**

We all know that Discord is an excellent tool for a community to come together and chat and discuss. Still, it can be challenging to go into focussed, target-orientated discussions.

This is why the IF has decided to restructure the research forum iota.cafe into a more governance and community focussed forum und the new domain [govern.iota.org](https://govern.iota.org/)

Feel free to use it for all governance-related, more detailed discussions and discussions around the Tangle improvement proposal process, where everyone is invited to propose changes to the IOTA protocol.

Of course, the forum also still hosts the Research forum around IOTA 2.0 development.

The forum allows you to log in using your IOTA Discord credentials.



### **Contribute**

**The involved community members want to highlight that the above-discussed topics are all open to discussions for every community member that wants to engage or raise concerns or disagreements about it.
