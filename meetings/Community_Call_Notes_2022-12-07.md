**Community Governance Call 12.07.2022**

**Discussed:**

- Governance forum admins come from IOTA Foundation (only responsible for technical backend)
- Governance forum needs moderators that also act as governance coordinators 
- Mods should be recruited from the community (i.e. min. 6 months of activity in community)
- How to elect them: For now volunteers that are agreed upon by governance meeting participants 

Right now: @AndyW , @Deep_Sea “Bring_the_Shimmer”!!! @overclocked , min. 2 more needed

Their tasks: 

-   Manage the correct progression of proposals through voting process (phases 1 to 3)
-  Progression from phase 1 to phase 2: 1 moderator checks if requirements are met
-  Progression from phase 2 to phase 2: 4-eyes principle (i.e. 2 mods)

Roles on the governance forum:
- Governance forum members (every registered account is “member”)
- Proposal submitter (member that aims to introduce a change in governance. Are responsible for their proposal to meet all formal requirements)
- Voter (has voting rights in phase 2) Who will be allowed?
- Voting rights can be linked to forum and other social media activity
- Firefly Voters (phase 3)
- Phase 3 happens almost fully outside of forum (Github, then Tangle). Only announcement in forum
-    Proposer or Moderators creates event on Github that is complete Firefly text (proposal and answer texts)
-    Moderators must check that wording didng change between phase 2 and 3
-    Proposal can be retracted by proposer at any time (before its on chain), but it can not be edited once it is in phase 2 

Forum organization

-  2-layer strucutre

    Example: 

    Layer 1: "Governance proposals "

    Layer 2: Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3

**Decisions:**

-    Final decisions will be made on Discourse, based on (currently created and growing) Shimmer Governance document.
-    What makes it into this document: Generally accepted discussion points from the meetings.

**Next meeting:**

-    Wednesday meeting: Dr. Bian Mienert (spelling? @Phylo [IF] ) talks about legal frameworks for treasuries and DAOs
-    Friday meeting: Trust levels on Discourse (phase 2 voting weight)
